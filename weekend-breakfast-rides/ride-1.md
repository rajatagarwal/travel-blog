# Resuming the breakfast ride after years!

So this Saturday on 19th of June 2021 I went on a breakfast ride with my wife in our a week old Tesla Model 3 Long Range. It was so fun to drive. We went to [The Hellfire club](https://dublin.ie/live/stories/the-hell-fire-club/) for the trekking on the Montplenier hill at the Dublin Mountains.

First we went to the [Timertrove](https://www.timbertrove.com/) cafe which is famous for its brunch dishes. We had there chicken and veg sandwiches.

After that we parked our car in the Hellfire club and started our trekking. There are both normal routes and shortcuts through the woods, which are awesome.

The walk was about 30 mins long. There was an abandoned church on the summit of the Montplenier hill. It was a sunny day and quite warm by the Dublin standards. A few of the photographs of the summit:
